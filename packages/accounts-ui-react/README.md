# Universe Accounts UI

### THIS PACKAGE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

A replacement for `accounts-ui` designed to work in [Universe](http://unicms.io) ecosystem: [Modules](https://atmospherejs.com/universe/modules), React and Semantic UI.

## Installation

    meteor add universe:accounts-ui

- This package assumes that you're using React, but you have to add in on your own, e.g.
    * `meteor add react`
    
- This package uses Semantic UI styling classes, but you have to add styles on your own, e.g.
    * `meteor add semantic:ui`
    
- Login options will show based on installed packages and you need to add them manually, e.g.
    * `meteor add accounts-password accounts-facebook ...`

## Usage

- You need to set up own routes
- Place `accounts-ui` components where you wish to render forms
 
Basic usage could look like:

    import {ComboBox} from '{universe:accounts-ui}';
    
    Router.route('/login', {
        name: 'login',
        action () {
            ReactLayout.render(Layout, {
                content: <ComboBox />
            });
        }
    });
    
### Available components

- `LoginBox` - simple login form
- `RegisterBox` - simple register form
- `ComboBox` - both above forms combined into one
- `ResetPasswordBox` - password reset form

## Configuration
